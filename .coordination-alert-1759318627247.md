# File Coordination Alert


STOP! You are editing files without declaring them first.

You MUST follow the file coordination protocol:

1. BEFORE editing "start-devops-session.sh", create this declaration:

```json
// Save to: .file-coordination/active-edits/agent-manual-monitor.json
{
  "agent": "YOUR_AGENT_NAME",
  "session": "manual-monitor",
  "files": ["start-devops-session.sh"],
  "operation": "edit",
  "reason": "Describe what you're doing",
  "declaredAt": "2025-10-01T11:37:07.247Z",
  "estimatedDuration": 300
}
```

2. Check if any other agent has declared this file:
   - Look in .file-coordination/active-edits/ for other agents' declarations
   - If the file appears in another declaration, WAIT or choose a different file

3. Only proceed with editing after declaring and confirming no conflicts

This prevents merge conflicts and wasted work!
