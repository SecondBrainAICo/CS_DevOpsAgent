# ðŸ§ª CS_DevOpsAgent Multi-Session Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing multi-session Git operations and the CS_DevOpsAgent system across multiple concurrent sessions on a local machine.

## Test Suites Available

### 1. Standalone Multi-Session Test (`test-standalone-multi-session.sh`)
**Purpose**: Tests pure Git operations without DevOpsAgent dependencies
**Requirements**: Only Git and Bash
**Use Case**: Validating Git's concurrent session handling

### 2. E2E Multi-Session Test (`test-e2e-multi-session.sh`)
**Purpose**: Tests the complete CS_DevOpsAgent system
**Requirements**: Node.js, Git, DevOpsAgent components
**Use Case**: Full system validation including devops-agent features

## Quick Start

### Running Standalone Tests (Recommended)
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x test-standalone-multi-session.sh

# Run the test suite
./test-standalone-multi-session.sh
```

### Running Full E2E Tests
```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed
npm install

# Make script executable
chmod +x test-e2e-multi-session.sh

# Run the test suite
./test-e2e-multi-session.sh
```

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Parallel Operations Test
**What it tests**: Multiple Git sessions making commits simultaneously
**Expected behavior**: Some operations may fail with lock errors (this is correct Git behavior)
**Success criteria**: At least some commits succeed, demonstrating proper lock handling

### 2. Worktree Isolation Test
**What it tests**: Git worktree feature for agent isolation
**Expected behavior**: Each agent works in its own worktree without conflicts
**Success criteria**: All worktrees created and commits successful

### 3. Concurrent Branches Test
**What it tests**: Multiple branches being created and modified simultaneously
**Expected behavior**: Branches are created successfully, some operations may be serialized
**Success criteria**: All requested branches exist after test

### 4. File Locking Test
**What it tests**: Custom file locking mechanism for preventing conflicts
**Expected behavior**: Some sessions blocked when trying to access locked files
**Success criteria**: Lock mechanism prevents simultaneous file modifications

### 5. Session Recovery Test
**What it tests**: Ability to recover from interrupted sessions
**Expected behavior**: State is preserved and work can be resumed
**Success criteria**: Interrupted work is completed after recovery

### 6. Performance Test
**What it tests**: System performance under concurrent load
**Expected behavior**: Multiple operations complete within reasonable time
**Success criteria**: All files created, execution time is reasonable

### 7. Remote Operations Test
**What it tests**: Push/pull operations from multiple sessions
**Expected behavior**: Changes are synchronized through remote repository
**Success criteria**: All sessions can push their changes (may require retries)

## Understanding Test Results

### Successful Output
```
âœ“ All tests passed! âœ¨
Total Tests: 7
Passed: 7
Failed: 0
```

### Partial Success (Expected)
```
Total Tests: 7
Passed: 6
Failed: 1
```
Note: Some failures are expected and demonstrate proper conflict handling

### Common "Failures" That Are Actually Successes

1. **Git Lock Errors**: 
   - Error: `Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists`
   - Meaning: Git is properly preventing concurrent modifications
   - This is CORRECT behavior!

2. **Blocked Sessions**:
   - Message: `BLOCKED: Session X could not acquire lock`
   - Meaning: Custom locking is working as designed
   - This prevents data corruption

3. **Merge Conflicts**:
   - Error: Merge conflict messages
   - Meaning: Git is detecting conflicting changes
   - Manual resolution would be required in real scenario

## Manual Testing Procedures

### Test 1: Simple Multi-Session Commit
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd test-repo
echo "Session 1" > file1.txt
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Session 1 commit"

# Terminal 2 (simultaneously)
cd test-repo
echo "Session 2" > file2.txt
git add file2.txt
git commit -m "Session 2 commit"
```

### Test 2: Worktree-Based Isolation
```bash
# Create worktrees for different agents
git worktree add ../agent-claude -b agent/claude/main
git worktree add ../agent-copilot -b agent/copilot/main

# Work in each worktree independently
cd ../agent-claude
echo "Claude's work" > claude.txt
git add claude.txt
git commit -m "Claude's changes"

cd ../agent-copilot
echo "Copilot's work" > copilot.txt
git add copilot.txt
git commit -m "Copilot's changes"
```

### Test 3: Session State Recovery
```bash
# Start a session and save state
echo "working_on_feature_x" > .git/session_state
echo "Partial work" > feature.txt

# Kill the session (Ctrl+C)

# Recover in new session
if [ -f .git/session_state ]; then
    state=$(cat .git/session_state)
    echo "Resuming: $state"
    echo "Completed work" >> feature.txt
    git add feature.txt
    git commit -m "Completed feature X (recovered)"
fi
```

## Monitoring Active Sessions

### Check for Active Git Processes
```bash
ps aux | grep git
```

### Monitor File Locks
```bash
ls -la .git/*.lock 2>/dev/null
```

### View Git Worktrees
```bash
git worktree list
```

### Check Branch Status
```bash
git branch -a
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests hang or timeout
**Solution**: Kill any stuck Git processes
```bash
pkill -f git
rm -f .git/index.lock
```

### Issue: Permission denied errors
**Solution**: Ensure proper permissions
```bash
chmod -R u+rwx test-standalone-workspace
```

### Issue: Worktree errors
**Solution**: Clean up broken worktrees
```bash
git worktree prune
git worktree remove <path> --force
```

### Issue: Remote push failures
**Solution**: Pull latest changes first
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance Benchmarks
- Parallel commits: 5-10 operations in < 2 seconds
- Worktree creation: < 1 second per worktree
- Session recovery: < 1 second
- Remote sync: < 3 seconds for 3 sessions

### Monitoring Performance
```bash
# Time a test run
time ./test-standalone-multi-session.sh

# Check system resources during test
top -pid $(pgrep -f test-standalone)
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Multi-Session Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run standalone tests
        run: |
          chmod +x test-standalone-multi-session.sh
          ./test-standalone-multi-session.sh
```

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
./test-standalone-multi-session.sh
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Multi-session tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always run tests in isolated environment**: Use the test workspace directory
2. **Clean up after tests**: The scripts auto-cleanup, but verify manually if needed
3. **Review logs**: Check `logs_*/` directories for detailed information
4. **Test regularly**: Run after major changes to Git workflow
5. **Document failures**: Some failures are expected - document which ones

## Advanced Testing

### Stress Testing
```bash
# Run multiple test iterations
for i in {1..10}; do
    echo "Test iteration $i"
    ./test-standalone-multi-session.sh
    sleep 2
done
```

### Custom Test Scenarios
Add new test functions to the scripts:
```bash
test_custom_scenario() {
    print_test "Custom scenario description"
    # Your test logic here
    echo "PASS: Custom scenario" >> "$RESULTS_FILE"
}
```

## Summary

The testing framework validates that:
1. âœ… Git properly handles concurrent access with locking
2. âœ… Worktrees provide isolation for multiple agents
3. âœ… Session state can be recovered after interruption
4. âœ… Performance remains acceptable under load
5. âœ… Remote synchronization works across sessions

Remember: Some "failures" are actually successful demonstrations of conflict prevention!
