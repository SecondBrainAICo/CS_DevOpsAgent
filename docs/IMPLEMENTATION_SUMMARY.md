## Changes Implemented

### 1. House Rules Setup with Folder Structure Choice

**New Features:**
- Interactive prompt during first-time project setup
- User chooses between structured or flexible folder organization
- Automatic copying of appropriate template files

**Files Modified:**
- `src/house-rules-manager.js`
  - Added `initialSetup()` - Interactive prompt for folder structure preference
  - Added `setupHouseRules(withStructure)` - Copies appropriate template
  - Added `getInfrastructureTemplate()` - Creates infrastructure.md

**User Experience:**
```
📋 House Rules Setup
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Would you like to enforce a structured folder organization?

  ✅ YES - Get comprehensive folder structure with guidelines
     • Modular organization (/ModuleName/src/featurename/)
     • Best for: New projects, large applications
     • Includes: houserules + folders.md guide

  ❌ NO  - Use flexible structure (organize your own way)
     • No enforced folder structure
     • Best for: Existing projects, quick setup
     • Includes: Core house rules only

Do you want structured folder organization? (Y/N) [N]:
```

**What Gets Copied:**

| Choice | Files Copied | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **YES (Y)** | `houserules_structured.md` → `houserules.md` | Full structured version with folder guidelines |
| | `folders.md` | Detailed folder structure guide |
| | `infrastructure/infrastructure.md` | Infrastructure documentation template |
| **NO (N)** | `houserules_core.md` → `houserules.md` | Core version without folder structure |
| | `infrastructure/infrastructure.md` | Infrastructure documentation template |

### 2. Always Option for Auto-Merge (24x7 Operation)

**New Features:**
- "Always" option saves auto-merge settings permanently
- Enables hands-off 24x7 operation with automatic rollover
- Settings persist across all future sessions

**Files Modified:**
- `src/session-coordinator.js`
  - Added `ensureHouseRulesSetup()` - Calls house rules setup on first run
  - Updated `promptForMergeConfig()` - Added "Always" option (Y/N/A)
  - Auto-merge settings saved to `project-settings.json` when Always selected

**User Experience:**
```
═══ Auto-merge Configuration ═══

Options:
  Y) Yes - Enable for this session only
  N) No - Disable for this session
  A) Always - Enable and remember for all sessions (24x7 operation)

Enable auto-merge? (Y/N/A) [N]: A

✓ Auto-merge configuration saved:
  Today's work → main
  Strategy: pull-request
  Mode: Always enabled (24x7 operation - auto rollover)
```

**Settings Storage:**

Stored in `local_deploy/project-settings.json`:
```json
{
  "autoMergeConfig": {
    "autoMerge": true,
    "targetBranch": "main",
    "strategy": "pull-request",
    "requireTests": true,
    "alwaysEnabled": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Session Coordinator Integration

**Flow:**
1. First session creation triggers:
   - Global setup (developer initials) - once per user
   - Project setup (versioning) - once per project
   - **House rules setup** - once per project ← NEW
2. House rules setup checks if `houserules.md` exists
3. If not, prompts for folder structure choice
4. Copies appropriate templates
5. Creates infrastructure directory and template

## Benefits

### For Users:
✅ **Flexible Setup** - Choose organization style that fits your project
✅ **24x7 Operation** - Set and forget with Always option
✅ **Clean Projects** - Infrastructure docs auto-created
✅ **No Repetition** - Saved settings used for all future sessions

### For 24x7 Agents:
✅ **Automatic Rollover** - Daily branch merges happen automatically
✅ **No Manual Intervention** - Always setting remembered permanently
✅ **Consistent Behavior** - Same settings across restarts

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test new project setup with structured folder choice (Y)
- [ ] Test new project setup with flexible folder choice (N)
- [ ] Verify `houserules_structured.md` copied correctly
- [ ] Verify `houserules_core.md` copied correctly
- [ ] Verify `folders.md` copied when structured selected
- [ ] Verify `infrastructure/infrastructure.md` created in both cases
- [ ] Test auto-merge with "Always" option
- [ ] Verify settings saved to `project-settings.json`
- [ ] Test that subsequent sessions use saved settings
- [ ] Test existing project (houserules already exist) - should skip setup

## Files Changed

1. `src/house-rules-manager.js` - Added 270+ lines
   - `initialSetup()` method
   - `setupHouseRules()` method

- Auto-merge prompted every session
- No way to save "always enable" preference

### After:
- Automatic house rules setup on first session
- Interactive choice for folder structure
- Auto-merge saved with "Always" option
- 24x7 operation fully supported
