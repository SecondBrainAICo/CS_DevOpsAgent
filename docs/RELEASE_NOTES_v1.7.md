# Release Notes - DevOps Agent v1.7.x Series

## 📦 Current Version: v1.7.2

**Release Date**: January 10, 2025  
**NPM Package**: `s9n-devops-agent@1.7.2`  
**Status**: Stable Production Release

---

## 🎯 v1.7.x Series Overview

The v1.7.x series represents a major evolution of the DevOps Agent with enhanced branch management, critical file coordination fixes, and improved user experience. This series focuses on enabling true parallel multi-agent workflows without conflicts.

## v1.7.2 - Version Display Fix (January 10, 2025)

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Session Coordinator Version**: Fixed hardcoded v1.4.8 displaying instead of current version
- **README Header**: Updated to v1.7.2
- **Start Script Banner**: Updated to v1.7.2 with build 20251010.03
- **Consistency**: All components now display matching version numbers

### 💡 Why This Release
User reported seeing v1.4.8 after updating to v1.7.1. The session coordinator had a hardcoded version string that wasn't updated during the v1.7.0 major release. This patch ensures all entry points show the correct version.

### 📦 Installation
```bash
npm install -g s9n-devops-agent@latest
```

### 🔍 Verification
```bash
s9n-devops-agent --version
# Output: CS_DevOpsAgent v1.7.2
```

## v1.7.1 - Update Check Visibility (January 10, 2025)

### ✨ Added
- **Visible Update Check**: Shows "🔍 Checking for DevOps Agent updates..." when checking npm registry
- **Up-to-Date Confirmation**: Displays "✓ DevOps Agent is up to date (vX.X.X)" when current
- **Offline Handling**: Shows helpful error message if update check fails due to network/npm issues

### 🔄 Changed
- Update check now provides transparent feedback instead of running silently
- Users can see when version check happens and its result

### 💡 Why This Release
Previously, the update check (introduced in v1.4.3) ran invisibly in the background, causing confusion. Users couldn't tell if the check was happening or if they were up to date. This release adds clear, transparent feedback.

## v1.7.0 - Enhanced Branch Management (January 10, 2025)

### 🚨 CRITICAL FIX
- **File Lock Timing**: Fixed critical race condition where locks were released after commit instead of after session close
- **Session-Lifetime Locks**: Locks now held for ENTIRE session until merge/worktree removal
- **Stop-and-Ask Protocol**: Agents must explicitly request user permission to edit files locked by other agents
- **Prevents Merge Conflicts**: Eliminates race conditions where two agents edit same files in parallel sessions

#### Why This Fix Is Critical

**Before v1.7.0:**
1. Agent A finishes editing files and commits
2. Lock released immediately after commit
3. Agent B starts editing same files
4. Both sessions conflict when merging → Manual resolution required

**After v1.7.0:**
1. Agent A holds locks until session merged
2. Agent B blocked from editing (sees red alert)
3. Zero conflicts when merging → Seamless workflow

**Impact**: Enables true parallel multi-agent workflows without manual conflict resolution

### ✨ Added - Enhanced Branch Management

#### Dual Merge Support
- Sessions merge to BOTH daily branch (`manus_MMDD_*`) AND main branch
- Hierarchical branching: `session/* → daily/* → main`
- Automatic merge to both targets on session close
- No manual intervention needed

#### Weekly Consolidation
- Automatic weekly branch cleanup and consolidation
- Rolls up daily branches into weekly summaries
- Keeps repository clean and organized
- Configurable consolidation schedule

#### Orphan Session Cleanup
- Detects and cleans up stale session branches
- Identifies sessions that were never closed properly
- Automatic cleanup of abandoned worktrees
- Prevents repository clutter

#### Comprehensive Testing
- 7 automated test cases covering all merge scenarios
- End-to-end validation with 2 parallel agents
- Test coverage for conflicts, undeclared edits, and merges
- All 10/10 tests passing

#### Enhanced Status Display
- Shows both daily and main merge status
- Clear visualization of branch hierarchy
- Detailed merge history and tracking
- Real-time session status updates

### 🔄 Changed
- House rules updated to clarify file lock lifetime requirements
- Session close now releases locks only after successful merge
- Enhanced-close-session script handles dual merges automatically
- Documentation updated with lock timing best practices

### 🐛 Fixed
- Prevents overlapping edits when agents finish at different times
- Eliminates duplicate work from parallel edits to same files
- Removes race condition in file coordination system
- Resolves session cleanup edge cases

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated README with session-lifetime lock behavior
- Added file coordination best practices
- Documented stop-and-ask protocol for conflict resolution
- Created comprehensive test results and analysis documents

## 🎓 Key Learnings from v1.7.x

### Race Condition Discovery
The critical file lock timing issue was discovered during real-world testing with multiple parallel agent sessions in the CS_TechWriterAgent repository. This led to the emergency fix in v1.7.0.

### User Feedback Integration
- v1.7.1: User reported invisible update check → Fixed same day
- v1.7.2: User saw old version number → Fixed within hours
- Demonstrates rapid response to user feedback

### Testing Validation
Comprehensive end-to-end testing with actual multi-agent scenarios proved the effectiveness of the file coordination fixes and dual merge system.
