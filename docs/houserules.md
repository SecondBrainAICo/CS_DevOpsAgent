# Claude House Rules for CS_DevOpsAgent

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: File Coordination Protocol (MUST FOLLOW)

**IMPORTANT: Always check the house rules at the beginning of each session!**

To prevent conflicts with other agents editing the same files, you MUST follow this protocol:

### Before Editing ANY Files:

1. **DECLARE YOUR INTENT FIRST**
   Create a file at `.file-coordination/active-edits/<your-name>-<session>.json` with:
   ```json
   {
     "agent": "<your-name>",
     "session": "<session-id>",
     "files": ["list", "of", "files", "you", "will", "edit"],
     "operation": "edit",
     "reason": "Brief description of what you're doing",
     "declaredAt": "<current-ISO-8601-timestamp>",
     "estimatedDuration": 300
   }
   ```

2. **CHECK FOR CONFLICTS**
   - Read ALL files in `.file-coordination/active-edits/`
   - If ANY other agent has declared the same files, you must:
     - WAIT for them to finish, OR
     - Choose different files to edit

3. **ONLY EDIT DECLARED FILES**
   - Never edit files you haven't declared
   - Stay within your declared scope

4. **RELEASE WHEN DONE**
   - Delete your declaration file after completing edits
   - Or move it to `.file-coordination/completed-edits/`

### If You Detect a Conflict:
- DO NOT proceed with edits
- Report the conflict to the user
- Wait or choose alternative files

### Helper Scripts Available:
- `./scripts/coordination/check-file-availability.sh <files>` - Check if files are available
- `./scripts/coordination/declare-file-edits.sh <agent> <session> <files>` - Declare your intent
- `./scripts/coordination/release-file-edits.sh <agent> <session>` - Release files after editing

**This coordination prevents wasted work and merge conflicts!**

## Testing Policy (Required)

Goal: Every bug fix and feature ships with an executable test.

Location: test_cases/<area>/<component>/.

DoD: (1) failing test reproduces bug (red), (2) fix makes it pass (green), (3) tests wired into CI and local runner.

Naming: YYYYMMDD_<short-slug>_spec.(py|ts|js|go|rb|java)

Non-duplication: Extend existing tests for the same bug.

Determinism: No flaky/random tests; use seeds and fake timers.

## Test Generation Rules (for Claude / code assistants)

Always write the failing test first.

Infer <area>/<component> from changed paths.

Stub external services; avoid real I/O unless explicitly needed.

Use native runners per language (pytest, vitest/jest, go test, rspec, JUnit).

Add short "why it failed before the fix" note in the test.

## Test Case Template
```
# Test Case: <human title>
- Area: <e.g., worktree>
- Component: <e.g., manager>
- Related Issue/PR: <#id or link>
- Repro Summary: <steps/inputs>
- Expected Behavior: <should happen>
- Regression Guard: <what breaks if it fails again>
```

<code block with the actual test file content>

## Partial Test Execution (Targeted Runs)

By default, local runs and CI only execute tests for changed areas (files in the PR/branch).

Areas are inferred from changed file paths and mapped to test_cases/<area>/<component> directories.

If we can't infer a mapping, we fallback to full suite.

You can override the scope:

scripts/run-tests --all â†’ full suite

scripts/run-tests --changed â†’ only changed areas (default)

scripts/run-tests test_cases/<area>/<component> â†’ specific folder

## Logging Policy

All test scripts log with UTC timestamps, levels (INFO/WARN/ERROR/DEBUG), and grouping for CI.

Set LOG_LEVEL to debug|info|warn|error (default info).

Enable deep tracing with TRACE=1 (verbose commands, environment, and selection decisions).

## Auto-Run on Bugfix Workflow

If the current branch name or latest commit message contains fix: or bug:, targeted tests for the affected areas run first; if they pass, we run the rest of that language's suite.

CI blocks merge if: tests fail or a bugfix PR lacks an associated test.

## Code Style Guidelines for CS_DevOpsAgent

### Comment Style
- Use descriptive header comments for major sections
- Include purpose and key features at the top of files
- Document complex logic inline
- Keep comments concise but informative

### Module Structure
- Group related functionality together
- Use clear section separators
- Export modules properly for reuse
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Log errors with appropriate levels
- Provide useful error messages
- Clean up resources on failure

### Worktree Management Specifics
- Always check if running in CS_DevOpsAgent repo itself
- Detect agent from environment variables
- Create isolated worktrees per agent
- Maintain agent configuration files
- Handle branch naming consistently

## Usage Examples

Run only changed areas (default):
```bash
scripts/run-tests --changed
```

Force full suite:
```bash
scripts/run-tests --all
```

Force a folder (e.g., during triage):
```bash
scripts/run-tests test_cases/worktree/manager
```

Increase logs:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug scripts/run-tests --changed
TRACE=1 scripts/run-tests --changed
```

## Infrastructure Documentation Policy (NEW)

### Purpose
Track all infrastructure changes in a centralized location for team visibility and compliance.

### Location
`/Documentation/infrastructure.md` - Created automatically if it doesn't exist.

### What to Document
- **Configuration Changes**: Environment variables, settings files, config updates
- **Dependency Updates**: New packages, version changes, removals
- **Build System Changes**: Scripts, build configs, CI/CD updates
- **Architecture Changes**: New services, components, integrations
- **Database Changes**: Schema updates, migrations, indexes
- **API Changes**: Endpoints, authentication, rate limits
- **Security Changes**: Auth updates, certificates, permissions

### Format
```markdown
## [Date] - [Agent/Developer Name]
### Category: [Config|Dependencies|Build|Architecture|Database|API|Security]
**Change Type**: [Added|Modified|Removed|Fixed]
**Component**: [Affected component/service]
**Description**: Brief description of the change
**Reason**: Why this change was necessary
**Impact**: Potential impacts or considerations
**Files Changed**: 
- file1.js
- config/settings.json
```

### Auto-Detection Rules
1. Monitor for changes in:
   - `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
   - `.env`, `.env.*` files
   - `*config*.js`, `*config*.json`
   - `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/*`
   - Database migration files
   - API route definitions

2. Auto-generate entry when detected
3. Include in commit message: `infra:` prefix when infrastructure changes detected

### Commit Message Enhancement
When infrastructure changes are detected:
```
infra(category): description

- Updated /Documentation/infrastructure.md
- [List of infrastructure changes]
```

Example:
```
infra(deps): add worktree management dependencies

- Updated /Documentation/infrastructure.md
- Added chokidar@3.5.3 for file watching
- Added execa@6.1.0 for process management
- Modified package.json scripts
```

## Environment Variables for Worktree Management

- `AGENT_NAME` or `AI_AGENT`: Identifies the AI agent
- `AGENT_TASK` or `AI_TASK`: Task or feature being worked on
- `AC_USE_WORKTREE`: Enable/disable worktree creation (true/false/auto)
- `AC_MSG_FILE`: Path to agent-specific commit message file
- `AC_BRANCH_PREFIX`: Prefix for agent branches
- `AC_TRACK_INFRA`: Enable infrastructure tracking (default: true)
- `AC_INFRA_DOC_PATH`: Path to infrastructure doc (default: /Documentation/infrastructure.md)

## Prep TODO & Coordination (Multi-Agent Handshake)

**Purpose:** Prevent agents from stepping on each other by publishing an _edit plan_ before changing files. The commit agent reads these plans, reserves shards (coarse path buckets), and either **acknowledges** or **blocks** the work.

### Agent Workflow

**Agents MUST write** a single JSON at `.ac-prep/<agent>.json` **before** edits and wait for `.ac/ack/<agent>.json`.

### Prep JSON Format
```json
{
  "agent": "<agent-id>",
  "task": "<short-slug>",
  "branch": "<target-branch>",
  "paths": ["<glob1>", "<glob2>"],
  "shards": ["<shard1>", "<shard2>"],
  "reason": "<why>",
  "priority": 1-10,
  "createdAt": "<ISO-8601>",
  "ttlMs": 600000
}
```

### Flow

1. **Write prep file** â†’ `.ac-prep/<agent>.json`
2. **Wait for acknowledgment** â†’ `.ac/ack/<agent>.json`
3. **Check status**:
   - `status:"ok"` â†’ proceed only within acknowledged paths/shards
   - `status:"blocked"` â†’ do not edit; narrow scope or wait; re-publish
   - `status:"queued"` â†’ wait for turn based on priority
4. **After edits** â†’ write `.claude-commit-msg` (Conventional Commit + 1â€“3 bullets)
5. **If alert appears** â†’ `.git/.ac/alerts/<agent>.md` â†’ re-run with narrower scope

### Shard System

Shards live in `.ac-shards.json`. The commit agent:
- **Reserves shards** on prep, acks or blocks
- **At commit**, claims shards and stages only owned files
- **Overlapping work** is blocked/queued/branched per config
- **Writes human alerts** to `.git/.ac/alerts/<agent>.md` when overlap occurs

### Priority Levels
- `10`: Critical hotfix
- `7-9`: High priority features
- `4-6`: Normal development
- `1-3`: Low priority/cleanup

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
```
AC_SHARD_STRATEGY options:
- "block": Prevent overlapping edits (default)
- "branch": Create agent-specific branches
- "queue": Queue based on priority and timestamp
```

### Agent Identification
Agents are identified by:
- Environment variable: `AGENT_NAME` or `AI_AGENT`
- Auto-detection from API keys (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
- Session-based: `session-${USER}@${HOSTNAME}`

### Monitoring
Check coordination status:
```bash
ls -la .ac-prep/      # Pending prep requests
ls -la .ac/ack/       # Acknowledgments
ls -la .git/.ac/alerts/  # Conflict alerts
cat .git/.ac/claims/*.json  # Active claims
```
